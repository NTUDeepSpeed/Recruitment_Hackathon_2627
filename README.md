# RoboRacer Sim Racing — Track 2

**NTU DeepSpeed Recruitment Hackathon 26/27**

Write the software that drives a 1/10-scale racing car around a circuit it has
never seen, as fast as it can, without hitting anything. This track runs the
**compete** phase of the [RoboRacer Sim Racing League @ ICRA 2026](https://autodrive-ecosystem.github.io/competitions/roboracer-sim-racing-icra-2026/)
on the AutoDRIVE Simulator — the same vehicle, the same sensors, the same
circuit and the same devkit the ICRA teams raced.

> **Submission deadline: 18 October 2026, 23:59 (SGT)**

## Quick start

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NTUDeepSpeed/Recruitment_Hackathon_2627.git
cd Recruitment_Hackathon_2627
git checkout track2

./scripts/fetch_simulator.sh      # 140 MB, once
./install/linux/setup.sh          # or install/macos, or install/windows from WSL
./install/linux/run.sh            # builds if needed, then drops you into the container
```

Then, inside the container:

```sh
cd /hackathon/race_ws && colcon build --symlink-install
source install/local_setup.bash

# Terminal 1 — the simulator and the devkit bridge
ros2 launch roboracer_referee simulator.launch.py

# Terminal 2 — your car
ros2 run team_driver driver
```

Watch it drive, then go make it faster. When you want a score:

```sh
./scripts/evaluate.sh --team your_team_name
```

Pushing also races your entry on GitHub Actions and writes the result to the
workflow summary. On an untouched template it races the baseline instead, so
you can see the time to beat before writing a line of code. That workflow is
for reference only — it runs on GitHub's hardware and nothing it prints is
scored. **Your result is the organisers' run on the judging machine.**

Full walkthrough: **[docs/01-setup.md](docs/01-setup.md)**.

> No submodules on this branch — a plain `git clone` is enough, and even a ZIP
> download works. The AutoDRIVE Devkit is committed to this repository; the
> simulator is a separate download that `./scripts/fetch_simulator.sh` handles.

## The challenge

You get a LiDAR scan, an IMU, wheel encoders, a camera and the car's exact
position. You publish a throttle and a steering command. That is the whole
interface.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Simulator** | AutoDRIVE Simulator, `2026-icra` **compete** build |
| **Car** | RoboRacer digital twin. Ackermann steering, 0.324 m wheelbase, 0.27 × 0.50 m, 3.9 kg, steering limited to ±0.5236 rad |
| **Sensor** | 1080-beam LiDAR, 270° field of view, 10 m range, 40 Hz — plus IMU, encoders and a front camera |
| **Control** | **Normalised throttle and steering, both in [−1, 1].** Not a speed request — closing that loop is your problem |
| **Localisation** | Ground-truth pose on `.../ips` and `.../odom` — **allowed and recommended** |
| **Track** | The ICRA 2026 compete circuit, inside the simulator. A long, narrow loop about 6.3 × 18.2 m with a 54 m lap, bounded by 33 cm air ducts, roughly 2 m wide and under 1 m at its tightest. |
| **Scored on** | Your single fastest lap, and your time for 10 consecutive laps |
| **Penalties** | +10 s on the lap for each collision; more than 10 collisions is a disqualification |
| **Judged on** | One machine: i9-14900HX, 32 GB, RTX 5060 Laptop. Times come from the simulator's own clock, so your hardware does not affect your score. |

Reactive algorithms like follow-the-gap will get you round. Planning — against
the map you build yourself, and against your own position — is where the lap
time is. And you are not required to build on the baselines at all —
**replacing the approach outright is encouraged**: reinforcement learning, MPC,
a learned end-to-end policy, anything you can defend. See
[docs/04-baselines.md](docs/04-baselines.md).

### What is different from Track 1

Both tracks are RoboRacer, and the racing problem is the same. The environment
is not, and four differences will bite you if you skim:

| | Track 1 | Track 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Simulator | `f1tenth_gym` + ROS bridge | **AutoDRIVE**, a Unity binary you download |
| Control | `AckermannDriveStamped` — ask for a speed | **`Float32` throttle in [−1, 1]** — ask for torque |
| Lap timing | Our referee, against a finish line in `maps/` | **The simulator's**, over the devkit bridge |
| The map | Shipped with the simulator | **Traced off the simulator** — it is in `maps/`, and a scored run ignores it |

The throttle one is the big one. There is no speed controller between your node
and the motor any more, so "take this corner at 3 m/s" is a control problem you
now own. [`control.py`](race_ws/src/roboracer_baselines/roboracer_baselines/control.py)
has a worked example to copy.

## Rules at a glance

The full rules are in **[docs/06-rules.md](docs/06-rules.md)** and they are what
counts. The short version:

- **Teams of 3 to 5.**
- **Deadline: 18 October 2026, 23:59 SGT.** Late entries are not scored.
- **AI assistants are allowed.** You will be asked to explain your code at the
  interview — generally, not line by line — so do not submit anything you
  cannot defend. A learned policy is held to the same standard, and meets it
  the same way: explain how you trained it and why, not what each weight
  means.
- **Do not modify the judging environment, and do not modify the AutoDRIVE
  Devkit.** Check yourself with `./scripts/verify_judging_env.sh`.
- **Every sensor topic is open to you, including ground-truth pose.** The
  AutoDRIVE competition marks some of those "restricted at race time"; this
  hackathon does not. The one thing you may not publish is
  `/autodrive/reset_command` — that is the referee's.
- **Score (out of 100):**

  | | Weight | Formula |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Fastest single lap | 50 | `50 × (fastest lap of any team ÷ your fastest lap)` |
  | 10-lap total | 50 | `50 × (fastest 10-lap total of any team ÷ your 10-lap total)` |

  An out lap and one warm-up lap are granted before timing starts. Each
  collision adds 10 s to the lap it happened on — about half a lap here — and
  more than 10 collisions in a run is a disqualification. Both baselines we
  ship are disqualified before the flag, so contact is the first problem to
  solve, not the last.

- **Bonus marks** at the interview, for work you can explain properly:
  replacing the ground-truth pose with your own localisation; building a map of
  the circuit and generating a racing line from it; or **replacing the driving
  algorithm entirely** — reinforcement learning, MPC, imitation learning,
  anything beyond tuning what we gave you.

## Getting help

- Check the troubleshooting section at the end of
  [docs/01-setup.md](docs/01-setup.md) first — most problems are there, and the
  two most common ones (a bridge that connects and then publishes nothing, and
  a simulator that cannot find the bridge) both look like something else.
- Bring the exact error text and what you ran to the team channel.
- `./scripts/verify_judging_env.sh` will tell you if your environment has
  drifted from the official one.
- You may email `ntu-deepspeed@e.ntu.edu.sg` for further inquiries if you cannot
  solve the issues after troubleshooting.

Good luck. Go fast.
