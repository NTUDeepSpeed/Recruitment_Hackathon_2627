# RoboRacer Autonomous Racing — Track 1

**NTU DeepSpeed Recruitment Hackathon 26/27**

Write the software that drives a 1/10-scale racing car around a circuit it has
never seen, as fast as it can, without hitting anything. Everything you need —
the simulator, the judging environment, reference algorithms and every official
track — is in this repository. You will not need to clone anything else.

> **Submission deadline: 18 October 2026, 23:59 (SGT)**

## Quick start

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/NTUDeepSpeed/Recruitment_Hackathon_2627.git
cd Recruitment_Hackathon_2627
git checkout track1

./install/linux/setup.sh          # or install/macos, or install/windows from WSL
./install/linux/run.sh            # builds if needed, then drops you into the container
```

Then, inside the container:

```sh
cd /hackathon/race_ws && colcon build --symlink-install
source install/local_setup.bash

# Terminal 1 — the simulator
ros2 launch roboracer_referee simulator.launch.py

# Terminal 2 — your car
ros2 run team_driver driver
```

Watch it drive, then go make it faster. When you want a score:

```sh
./scripts/evaluate.sh --team your_team_name
```

Pushing also races your entry on GitHub Actions and writes the result to the
workflow summary. On an untouched template it races the baselines instead, so
you can see the times to beat before writing a line of code. That workflow is
for reference only — it runs on GitHub's hardware and nothing it prints is
scored. **Your result is the organisers' run on the judging machine.**

Full walkthrough: **[docs/01-setup.md](docs/01-setup.md)**.

> Cloned without `--recurse-submodules`, or downloaded a ZIP? Run
> `git submodule update --init --recursive`. The setup scripts will also do it
> for you. A ZIP download will not work — submodules need a real clone.

## The challenge

You get a LiDAR scan and the car's exact position. You publish a steering angle
and a speed. That is the whole interface.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Car** | Ackermann steering, 0.33 m wheelbase, 0.31 × 0.58 m, steering limited to ±0.4189 rad |
| **Sensor** | 819-beam LiDAR, 270° field of view, 25 m range |
| **Localisation** | Ground-truth pose on `/ego_racecar/odom` — **allowed and recommended** |
| **Track** | `icra26`, in this repository. 17 x 18 m, about 78 m a lap, cone slaloms and a hairpin complex. |
| **Scored on** | Your single fastest lap, and your time for 10 consecutive laps |
| **Penalties** | +10 s on the lap for each collision; more than 10 collisions is a disqualification |
| **Judged on** | One machine: i9-14900HX, 32 GB, RTX 5060 Laptop. Times are in simulated seconds, so your own hardware does not affect your score. |

Reactive algorithms like follow-the-gap will get you round. Planning against
the map and your own position is where the lap time is. And you are not
required to build on the baselines at all — **replacing the approach outright
is encouraged**: reinforcement learning, MPC, a learned end-to-end policy,
anything you can defend. The environment is ROS 2 Jazzy on Python 3.12 with a
GPU available, so a learned policy is a realistic option. See
[docs/04-baselines.md](docs/04-baselines.md).

| --- | --- |
| **[1. Setup](docs/01-setup.md)** | Installing Docker, building the image, first run, troubleshooting |
| **[2. The simulator](docs/02-simulator.md)** | Topics, message types, changing tracks, RViz, ground-truth odometry |
| **[3. ROS 2 primer](docs/03-workshop.md)** | Nodes, topics and the workshop slides, if ROS is new to you |
| **[4. Baseline algorithms](docs/04-baselines.md)** | Wall following, follow-the-gap, pure pursuit — how they work and where they break |
| **[5. Evaluation](docs/05-evaluation.md)** | Scoring yourself, reading result files, how judging day runs |
| **[6. Rules](docs/06-rules.md)** | The rules, the scoring formula, and what gets you disqualified |
| **[7. Submission](docs/07-submission.md)** | What to hand in, how, and what the interview covers |

## Rules at a glance

The full rules are in **[docs/06-rules.md](docs/06-rules.md)** and they are what
counts. The short version:

- **Teams of 3 to 5.**
- **Deadline: 18 October 2026, 23:59 SGT.** Late entries are not scored.
- **AI assistants are allowed.** You will be asked to explain your code at the
  interview — generally, not line by line — so do not submit anything you
  cannot defend. A learned policy is held to the same standard, and meets it
  the same way: explain how you trained it and why, not what each weight
  means.
- **Do not modify the judging environment.** Check yourself with
  `./scripts/verify_judging_env.sh`.
- **Score (out of 100):**

  | | Weight | Formula |
  | --- | --- | --- |
  | Fastest single lap | 50 | `50 × (fastest lap of any team ÷ your fastest lap)` |
  | 10-lap total | 50 | `50 × (fastest 10-lap total ÷ your 10-lap total)` |

  One warm-up lap is granted before timing starts. Each collision adds 10 s to
  the lap it happened on. More than 10 collisions in a run is a
  disqualification.

- **Bonus marks** at the interview, for work you can explain properly:
  replacing the ground-truth odometry with your own localisation; generating a
  racing line from the map at runtime; or **replacing the driving algorithm
  entirely** — reinforcement learning, MPC, imitation learning, anything
  beyond tuning what we gave you.

## Getting help

- Check the troubleshooting section at the end of
  [docs/01-setup.md](docs/01-setup.md) first — most problems are there.
- Bring the exact error text and what you ran to the team channel.
- `./scripts/verify_judging_env.sh` will tell you if your environment has
  drifted from the official one.
- You may email `ntu-deepspeed@e.ntu.edu.sg` for further inquiries if you cannot solve the issues after troubleshooting.

Good luck. Go fast.
