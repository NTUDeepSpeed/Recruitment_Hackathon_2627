# 1. Setup

There are two pieces to install, and they are installed in different ways.

**The container** holds ROS 2 Humble, the AutoDRIVE Devkit, the reference
algorithms and the judging environment. You build it once from this repository.

**The AutoDRIVE Simulator** is a Unity binary — about 140 MB — that is not in
this repository and not in the image. One script downloads it.

Your code lives on your own machine and is mounted into the container at
`/hackathon`, so you edit files in your normal editor and nothing is lost when
the container stops.

---

## 1.1 Get the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NTUDeepSpeed/Recruitment_Hackathon_2627.git ~/Recruitment_Hackathon_2627
cd ~/Recruitment_Hackathon_2627
git checkout track2
```

No `--recurse-submodules` on this branch and no submodules to forget: the
AutoDRIVE Devkit is committed into `external/autodrive_devkit/`. A ZIP download
works too, though a real clone is easier to submit from later.

---

## 1.2 Install Docker

### Windows 10/11

1. Install [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
2. Install WSL 2. Open **PowerShell as Administrator**:
   ```powershell
   wsl --install
   ```
   Reboot when it asks.
3. In Docker Desktop, go to **Settings → Resources → WSL integration**, enable
   your Ubuntu distro, and click **Apply & Restart**.
4. From then on, work in a WSL terminal:
   ```powershell
   wsl --set-default Ubuntu
   wsl ~
   ```

> Everything after this point happens **inside WSL**, not in PowerShell. If you
> run the scripts from PowerShell they will tell you so and stop.

> Cannot paste into the terminal? Right-click the window title → *Properties* →
> tick *Use Ctrl+Shift+C/V as Copy/Paste*.

### macOS

1. Install the Xcode command line tools if you have not already:
   ```sh
   xcode-select --install
   ```
2. Install [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
   — pick the Apple Silicon or Intel build to match your machine.
3. Launch Docker Desktop and wait for the whale icon to stop animating.

Apple Silicon works, with one wrinkle: the simulator is a native macOS build and
runs on your Mac rather than in the container. See §1.6.

### Ubuntu / Debian Linux

1. Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
   Do **not** use Docker Desktop on Linux — it runs a VM you do not need and it
   is the usual reason a container cannot see a GPU.
2. Add yourself to the `docker` group so you do not need `sudo`:
   ```sh
   sudo usermod -aG docker "$USER"
   newgrp docker
   ```
   (Full instructions: [post-install steps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).)
3. Check it works:
   ```sh
   docker run --rm hello-world
   ```

---

## 1.3 Fetch the simulator

```sh
./scripts/fetch_simulator.sh
```

It works out which build you need, downloads it from the AutoDRIVE release and
unpacks it into `simulator/`. That folder is in `.gitignore`: it is never
committed, and the script is how everyone — including the judges and CI — gets
the same binary.

```sh
./scripts/fetch_simulator.sh --check      # what is installed?
./scripts/fetch_simulator.sh --force      # download it again
./scripts/fetch_simulator.sh --platform macos
```

On Linux and WSL you want the Linux build, which is the default: it runs inside
the container and that is what a scored run drives. On macOS and Windows you
want the native build, which runs on your host — §1.6.

> The download is about 140 MB and the release carries no checksum, so the
> script's only integrity check is that what came back is a readable archive of
> roughly the right size. If it complains that the download is a few kilobytes,
> something on your network handed back a login page; try again, or fetch the
> URL it prints in a browser and unzip it into `simulator/` yourself.

---

## 1.4 Build the image

Pick the folder for your platform. The commands below use Linux; swap in
`macos` or `windows` as appropriate.

```sh
cd ~/Recruitment_Hackathon_2627
./install/linux/setup.sh
```

This takes **10 to 20 minutes** the first time: it pulls the ROS 2 Humble base
image and installs RViz, the devkit's dependencies and the graphics libraries
the simulator links against. Later builds are cached and take seconds.

If a build step fails, read the last few lines of output — the Dockerfile
checks its own work and says which step broke and why.
`./install/linux/setup.sh --no-cache` forces a clean rebuild.

> **ROS 2 Humble, not Jazzy.** That is deliberate: the official AutoDRIVE
> competition image is `ros:humble`, and the devkit's websocket stack only
> works on the versions that ship with it. Track 1 was Jazzy; this is not.

---

## 1.5 Start the container

```sh
./install/linux/run.sh
```

You land in a shell inside the container, at `/hackathon`. ROS is already
sourced.

For more terminals — and you will want three or four — open new host terminals
and run:

```sh
./install/linux/shell.sh
```

To shut everything down:

```sh
./install/linux/stop.sh
```

### Where the simulator window appears

| Platform | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Linux | Directly on your desktop, via the host X server |
| Windows / WSL | Directly on your desktop, via WSLg |
| macOS | On your Mac — the simulator runs natively, see §1.6 |

If nothing appears on Linux or WSL, fall back to the browser:

```sh
./install/linux/run.sh --novnc
```

and open <http://localhost:8080/vnc.html>.

You do not need a window at all to race. A scored run is headless.

### GPU

If an NVIDIA GPU is visible, `run.sh` attaches it automatically and falls back
to CPU-only if Docker cannot. Force it either way with `--gpu` or `--no-gpu`.

The GPU is there for **your** code — a learned policy, a planner — and for
rendering the simulator when you want to watch it. A scored run uses
`-batchmode -nographics`, which creates no graphics device at all, so judging
does not depend on it. The container is Python 3.10, so CUDA builds of PyTorch
and friends install and run; see [chapter 4](04-evaluation.md#48-judging-day).

---

## 1.6 Running the simulator on your host (macOS, Windows)

The container cannot run a native macOS or Windows simulator, so on those
platforms the simulator runs on your machine and the devkit runs in the
container. They talk over port 4567, which `docker-compose.yml` publishes.

**The direction of that connection is the opposite of what people expect, and
getting it backwards is the single most common setup failure.** The bridge
inside the container is the *server*: it listens on 4567. The simulator is the
*client*: you tell it where the bridge is and it dials out.

So the order is fixed:

1. Start the container and, inside it, the bridge:
   ```sh
   ros2 launch roboracer_referee simulator.launch.py simulator:=false rviz:=false
   ```
2. Then start the simulator on your host, by double-clicking it or:
   ```sh
   ./scripts/run_simulator.sh
   ```
3. In the simulator's **Menu Panel**, set the IP to `127.0.0.1` and the port to
   `4567`, and press **Connect**. Set the vehicle to **Autonomous**.

Topics appear the moment that connection lands. If they do not, nothing is
listening on 4567 — start the bridge first.

To score a run this way, tell `evaluate.sh` not to start a simulator of its own:

```sh
./scripts/evaluate.sh --team my_team --no-simulator
```

Linux and WSL users can do this too — it is a reasonable way to watch a run at
full graphics while everything else stays in the container — but the default
path, with both in the container, is simpler and is what judging uses.

---

## 1.7 Build the workspace and drive

Inside the container:

```sh
cd /hackathon/race_ws
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/local_setup.bash
```

`--symlink-install` means Python edits take effect without rebuilding. You only
need to re-run `colcon build` after adding a new file or changing `setup.py`.

Now, in two separate container shells:

```sh
# Terminal 1 — simulator and bridge
ros2 launch roboracer_referee simulator.launch.py

# Terminal 2 — your car
ros2 run team_driver driver
```

A car should set off round the track. That is the template driver in
[`race_ws/src/team_driver/team_driver/driver.py`](../race_ws/src/team_driver/team_driver/driver.py) —
slow, cautious, and yours to replace.

Try a stronger baseline for comparison:

```sh
ros2 run roboracer_baselines gap_follower
```

---

## 1.8 Check your environment is sane

```sh
./scripts/verify_judging_env.sh
```

This confirms the judging environment and the vendored devkit match the
official ones. Run it before you submit; an entry with a modified referee,
devkit or Dockerfile is not scored.

---

## 1.9 Troubleshooting

**Every topic is listed, but nothing ever publishes**
This is the one to know about. Check the socket:
```sh
netstat -tnp | grep 4567
```
*Nothing at all* — the simulator never reached the bridge. Is the bridge
running? Did you start the simulator first? Is the IP right?

*An `ESTABLISHED` connection and still no messages* — the TCP connection is up
but the Socket.IO handshake is not completing, which almost always means the
devkit's Python dependencies were replaced with newer ones. The pins in
`docker/devkit-requirements.txt` look absurdly old and are load-bearing; the
simulator advertises Engine.IO v4 in its handshake URL and then speaks v3
framing, so a modern `python-socketio` connects and then waits for ever.
Rebuild with `./install/<os>/setup.sh --no-cache`.

**`docker: command not found`, or "cannot connect to the Docker daemon"**
Docker Desktop is not running, or on Linux your user is not in the `docker`
group. On Windows, check Settings → Resources → WSL integration.

**`The AutoDRIVE Simulator is not installed`**
Run `./scripts/fetch_simulator.sh` on your **host**, not inside the container.
It lands in `simulator/`, which is bind-mounted, so the container sees it
immediately — no rebuild needed.

**The build fails at `apt-get` or `pip`**
Force a clean rebuild: `./install/linux/setup.sh --no-cache`. A half-cached
layer from an interrupted attempt is the usual cause.

**No simulator window**
Use `--novnc` and open <http://localhost:8080/vnc.html>. On Linux also check
`echo $DISPLAY` is set and try `xhost +local:root`. Remember you do not need a
window to race.

**The simulator prints pages of `Shader ... is not supported on this GPU`**
Normal and harmless in headless mode. `-nographics` means there is no GPU to
compile shaders for; the physics, the LiDAR and the lap timing are unaffected.
The ALSA and FMOD audio errors underneath them are the same story.

**The car does not move**
Check something is publishing:
```sh
ros2 topic hz /autodrive/roboracer_1/throttle_command
ros2 topic echo /autodrive/roboracer_1/throttle_command --once
```
No output means your driver node is not running or crashed — look at its
terminal. If it *is* publishing and the car still does not move, check that the
simulator is in **Autonomous** mode, not Manual.

**A topic exists, `ros2 topic info` shows a publisher, and `echo` shows nothing**
Quality-of-Service mismatch. The bridge publishes `RELIABLE` with a queue depth
of 1; a `BEST_EFFORT` subscriber — which is what people reach for with sensor
data — will never receive one message from it, silently. Use the profile in
[`control.py`](../race_ws/src/roboracer_baselines/roboracer_baselines/control.py).

**`ros2: command not found` inside the container**
You are in a shell that did not source ROS. Exit and use
`./install/<os>/shell.sh`, or run `source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash` by hand.

**`Package 'team_driver' not found`**
The workspace is not built or not sourced:
```sh
cd /hackathon/race_ws && colcon build --symlink-install && source install/local_setup.bash
```

**`Permission denied` deleting `race_ws/build` on the host**
The container builds as root through the bind mount. Delete them from inside
the container instead:
```sh
./install/linux/shell.sh 'rm -rf /hackathon/race_ws/build /hackathon/race_ws/install /hackathon/race_ws/log'
```

**A run fails to start with "address already in use"**
A bridge from a previous run is still holding port 4567.
`./scripts/evaluate.sh` cleans up after itself, but a run killed with Ctrl-C
partway through may not have. Inside the container:
```sh
pkill -f autodrive_bridge; pkill -f 'AutoDRIVE Simulator'
```

**Port 8080 is already in use**
```sh
NOVNC_PORT=8081 ./install/macos/run.sh
```
