"""Lap timing, penalties and scoring for a single evaluation run.

This module deliberately contains no ROS code. The referee node feeds it the
AutoDRIVE Simulator's race telemetry; everything about *what a lap is worth*
lives here, so the rules can be unit tested without standing up a simulator.

Track 2 does not time laps itself. The AutoDRIVE Simulator owns the
start/finish line and the track boundaries, and reports lap count, lap times
and a collision count over the devkit bridge. Those numbers are the ground
truth a scored run is built from - see docs/04-evaluation.md - which is why
there is no finish-line geometry anywhere in this package.

All times are the simulator's own, never the referee's wall clock.
