"""Run one scored evaluation: simulator (optional), driver node, referee.

    # Full run, simulator included
    ros2 launch roboracer_referee evaluate.launch.py team:=my_team

    # Against a simulator you already have open
    ros2 launch roboracer_referee evaluate.launch.py team:=my_team simulator:=false

    # A different entry point or package
    ros2 launch roboracer_referee evaluate.launch.py \
        team:=my_team driver_pkg:=roboracer_baselines driver_exec:=gap_follower

The whole launch shuts down as soon as the referee exits, so a run always ends
by itself and never leaves a driver spinning against an empty simulator.
