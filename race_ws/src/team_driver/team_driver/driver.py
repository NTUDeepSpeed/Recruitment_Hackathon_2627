"""YOUR DRIVER GOES HERE.

This is the node the judges run. Keep `driver` as the executable name and
`/drive` as the output topic and everything else is yours to change - rewrite
this file completely if you want to.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
THIS TEMPLATE DOES NOT DRIVE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is wiring, not a driver. It connects to the simulator, subscribes to the
sensors, and then asks for a slow constant speed with the wheels straight. It
will set off from the grid and into the first thing in front of it. That is
deliberate and it is the whole point: **there is no algorithm here and no
algorithm is shipped anywhere else in this repository.** Writing one is the
hackathon.

What the template is good for is proving your setup works. If the car moves
when you run it, then the image, the bridge, the workspace, the topics and
your commands are all correct, and every problem left is yours.

    ros2 run team_driver driver
    ros2 launch team_driver driver.launch.py

`docs/04-algorithms.md` lists the approaches worth starting from - reactive
ones that need nothing but the LiDAR, planners that follow a line, model-based
control, and learned policies - with what each needs and where each breaks.
Pick one and replace `plan()` below.

What you are allowed to read (see docs/06-rules.md):
    /scan               LiDAR, 819 beams over 270 degrees
    /ego_racecar/odom   ground-truth pose and velocity - ALLOWED and RECOMMENDED
    TF, /map            the static map
What you publish:
    /drive              AckermannDriveStamped - you ask for a SPEED, and the
                        simulator closes that loop for you
    /driver/...         anything of your own, for visualisation

        runs the controller that achieves it - so you can think in the units

        Right now it returns "straight ahead, slowly", which is not driving:
