# Workshop material

Reference material from the ROS 2 workshop, kept here so you can go back to it.
None of it is part of the hackathon build or the judging environment.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| [`slides/`](slides/) | ROS 2 theory and practical, Docker, reactive navigation. Markdown source and PDFs. |
| [`ros2_ws/`](ros2_ws/) | Teaching packages: publishers, subscribers, services, actions, custom messages, bag recording. |
| [`assets/`](assets/) | Images used by the slides. |

Start with [`../docs/03-workshop.md`](../docs/03-workshop.md) for the short
version.

## Paths in the slides are out of date

The slides were written against the old repository layout and the old
container. The concepts are unchanged; the paths are not.

| Slides say | Now |
| --- | --- |
| `~/F1Tenth_Workshop/install_linux` | `install/linux/` (also `install/macos`, `install/windows`) |
| `/f1tenth_workshop/` inside the container | `/hackathon/` |
| `/f1tenth_workshop/f1tenth_simulator` | `race_ws/src/team_driver/` — and the gap finder and wall follower templates the slides work through are no longer provided; see [docs/04-algorithms.md](../docs/04-algorithms.md) |
| `ros2_ws` | `race_ws` for your entry; `workshop/ros2_ws` for these teaching packages |
| Edit `sim.yaml` and rebuild to change map | `ros2 launch roboracer_referee simulator.launch.py track:=Nuerburgring` |

Also note that F1TENTH is now **RoboRacer**. The upstream simulator
repositories are still published under the old name (`f1tenth_gym`,
`f1tenth_gym_ros`, `f1tenth_racetracks`), so those names appear throughout the
code and are correct.

## Building the teaching packages

They are a separate workspace on purpose, so they are not compiled during an
evaluation run.

```sh
cd /hackathon/workshop/ros2_ws
colcon build --symlink-install
source install/local_setup.bash
ros2 run my_package minimal_publisher
```
