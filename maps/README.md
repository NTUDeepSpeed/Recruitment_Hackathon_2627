# maps/

**Nothing in this directory is used to score a run.** The AutoDRIVE Simulator
owns the circuit, the start/finish line, the lap counter and the collision
detection, and publishes all of it over the devkit bridge. The referee reads
that telemetry. See [docs/05-evaluation.md](../docs/05-evaluation.md).

What is here is for *your* planning.

| File | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `tracks.yaml` | Track metadata: the name in your result file, where the map lives, and the planning geometry |
| `icra26_compete.pgm` + `.yaml` | Occupancy grid of the compete circuit |
| `icra26_compete_centerline.csv` | Traced from the grid by `scripts/track_tool.py centerline` |

## Where the grid came from

The AutoDRIVE Simulator ships the circuit as Unity geometry, not as an
occupancy grid, so this one was traced from the simulator itself: ground-truth
pose plus the 1080-beam LiDAR, ray-carved into a grid over several laps.

It is checked against the thing it claims to describe. Every sample of a
recorded driving line falls on a free cell and none on a wall, and
`pure_pursuit` drives the centreline traced from it — a 19.87 s lap with no
contact. A map that quietly disagrees with the simulator is worse than no map,
so if you ever find this one disagreeing, that is a bug worth reporting
(rule 49).

Measured from the grid:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Grid | 220 × 476 px at 5 cm, origin (−7.96, −13.23) |
| Circuit bounding box | about 6.3 × 18.2 m |
| Lap length | 54.4 m down the traced centreline |
| Corridor width | about 2 m typical, under 1 m at the tightest point |
| Spawn | (0.80, 3.16) facing −y |
| Lap boundary | y = 3.80, just behind the grid slot |

**Building your own is still worth doing.** Ours is good enough to plan
against; it is not perfect, and a better one — or your own localisation
against it — is worth bonus marks at the interview (rule 45).

## Adding your own

Drop any `<name>.pgm` + `<name>.yaml` pair in here and point a tool at it, and
keep any racing line you generate here too — a path CSV in the
`s; x; y; psi; kappa; vx; ax` layout is the conventional format and the one
`./scripts/track_tool.py` writes. Load it from your driver by path:

```sh
ros2 run team_driver driver --ros-args \
    -p raceline_csv:=/hackathon/maps/my_line.csv
```

Files you add here are yours and are not checked by
`./scripts/verify_judging_env.sh` — unlike `tracks.yaml`, which is.
